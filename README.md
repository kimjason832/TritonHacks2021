About the Project:
SereneStudy is a timing program that not only allows users to input the amount of time desired for their study/to-do session, but also lets them make a checklist
of tasks for further organization. While the timer is counting off, users can see, simultaneously, what task corresponds to the current time interval.
The program also makes use of the pomodoro technique, efficiently combining work time and down time. The time set by the user is also flexible, meaning if a task is
finished early, they can move on early. Furthermore, the user can also enjoy a spark of motivation with our provided quotes of inspiration displayed during the work times.
